id: PYSEC-2020-223
details: In the course of work on the open source project it was discovered that authenticated
  users running queries against Hive and Presto database engines could access information
  via a number of templated fields including the contents of query description metadata
  database, the hashed version of the authenticated usersâ€™ password, and access to
  connection information including the plaintext password for the current connection.
  It would also be possible to run arbitrary methods on the database connection object
  for the Presto or Hive connection, allowing the user to bypass security controls
  internal to Superset. This vulnerability is present in every Apache Superset version
  < 0.37.2.
