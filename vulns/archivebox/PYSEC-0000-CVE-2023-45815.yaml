id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-45815
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
details: ArchiveBox is an open source self-hosted web archiving system. Any users
  who are using the `wget` extractor and view the content it outputs. The impact is
  potentially severe if you are logged in to the ArchiveBox admin site in the same
  browser session and view an archived malicious page designed to target your ArchiveBox
  instance. Malicious Javascript could potentially act using your logged-in admin
  credentials and add/remove/modify snapshots, add/remove/modify ArchiveBox users,
  and generally do anything an admin user could do. The impact is less severe for
  non-logged-in users, as malicious Javascript cannot *modify* any archives, but it
  can still *read* all the other archived content by fetching the snapshot index and
  iterating through it. Because all of ArchiveBox's archived content is served from
  the same host and port as the admin panel, when archived pages are viewed the JS
  executes in the same context as all the other archived pages (and the admin panel),
  defeating most of the browser's usual CORS/CSRF security protections and leading
  to this issue. A patch is being developed in https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/issues/239.
  As a mitigation for this issue would be to disable the wget extractor by setting
  `archivebox config --set SAVE_WGET=False`, ensure you are always logged out, or
  serve only a [static HTML version](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Publishing-Your-Archive#2-export-and-host-it-as-static-html)
  of your archive.
