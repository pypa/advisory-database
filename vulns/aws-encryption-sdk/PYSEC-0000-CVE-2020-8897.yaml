id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2020-8897
details: A weak robustness vulnerability exists in the AWS Encryption SDKs for Java,
  Python, C and Javalcript prior to versions 2.0.0. Due to the non-committing property
  of AES-GCM (and other AEAD ciphers such as AES-GCM-SIV or (X)ChaCha20Poly1305) used
  by the SDKs to encrypt messages, an attacker can craft a unique cyphertext which
  will decrypt to multiple different results, and becomes especially relevant in a
  multi-recipient setting. We recommend users update their SDK to 2.0.0 or later.
