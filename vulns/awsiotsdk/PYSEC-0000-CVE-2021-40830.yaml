id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-40830
details: 'The AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Java, Python, C++ and Node.js appends a user
  supplied Certificate Authority (CA) to the root CAs instead of overriding it on
  Unix systems. TLS handshakes will thus succeed if the peer can be verified either
  from the user-supplied CA or the system’s default trust-store. Attackers with access
  to a host’s trust stores or are able to compromise a certificate authority already
  in the host''s trust store (note: the attacker must also be able to spoof DNS in
  this case) may be able to use this issue to bypass CA pinning. An attacker could
  then spoof the MQTT broker, and either drop traffic and/or respond with the attacker''s
  data, but they would not be able to forward this data on to the MQTT broker because
  the attacker would still need the user''s private keys to authenticate against the
  MQTT broker. The ''aws_tls_ctx_options_override_default_trust_store_*'' function
  within the aws-c-io submodule has been updated to override the default trust store.
  This corrects this issue. This issue affects: Amazon Web Services AWS IoT Device
  SDK v2 for Java versions prior to 1.5.0 on Linux/Unix. Amazon Web Services AWS IoT
  Device SDK v2 for Python versions prior to 1.6.1 on Linux/Unix. Amazon Web Services
  AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for C++ versions prior to 1.12.7 on Linux/Unix. Amazon Web
  Services AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Node.js versions prior to 1.5.3 on Linux/Unix.
  Amazon Web Services AWS-C-IO 0.10.4 on Linux/Unix.'
