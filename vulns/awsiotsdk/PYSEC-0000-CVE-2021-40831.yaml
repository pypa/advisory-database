id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-40831
details: "The AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Java, Python, C++ and Node.js appends a user\
  \ supplied Certificate Authority (CA) to the root CAs instead of overriding it on\
  \ macOS systems. Additionally, SNI validation is also not enabled when the CA has\
  \ been \u201Coverridden\u201D. TLS handshakes will thus succeed if the peer can\
  \ be verified either from the user-supplied CA or the system\u2019s default trust-store.\
  \ Attackers with access to a host\u2019s trust stores or are able to compromise\
  \ a certificate authority already in the host's trust store (note: the attacker\
  \ must also be able to spoof DNS in this case) may be able to use this issue to\
  \ bypass CA pinning. An attacker could then spoof the MQTT broker, and either drop\
  \ traffic and/or respond with the attacker's data, but they would not be able to\
  \ forward this data on to the MQTT broker because the attacker would still need\
  \ the user's private keys to authenticate against the MQTT broker. The 'aws_tls_ctx_options_override_default_trust_store_*'\
  \ function within the aws-c-io submodule has been updated to address this behavior.\
  \ This issue affects: Amazon Web Services AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Java versions\
  \ prior to 1.5.0 on macOS. Amazon Web Services AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Python\
  \ versions prior to 1.7.0 on macOS. Amazon Web Services AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for\
  \ C++ versions prior to 1.14.0 on macOS. Amazon Web Services AWS IoT Device SDK\
  \ v2 for Node.js versions prior to 1.6.0 on macOS. Amazon Web Services AWS-C-IO\
  \ 0.10.7 on macOS."
