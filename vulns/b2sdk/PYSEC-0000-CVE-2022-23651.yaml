id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-23651
details: b2-sdk-python is a python library to access cloud storage provided by backblaze.
  Linux and Mac releases of the SDK version 1.14.0 and below contain a key disclosure
  vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through
  a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. SDK users of the SqliteAccountInfo
  format are vulnerable while users of the InMemoryAccountInfo format are safe. The
  SqliteAccountInfo saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database
  file ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info, ~/.b2_account_info or a user-defined path).
  When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds)
  later altered to be private to the user. If the directory containing the file is
  readable by a local attacker then during the brief period between file creation
  and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain
  a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file
  after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Consumers of this SDK who
  rely on it to save data using SqliteAccountInfo class should upgrade to the latest
  version of the SDK. Those who believe a local user might have opened a handle using
  this race condition, should remove the affected database files and regenerate all
  application keys. Users should upgrade to b2-sdk-python 1.14.1 or later.
