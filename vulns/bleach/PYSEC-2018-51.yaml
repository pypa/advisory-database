details: An issue was discovered in Bleach 2.1.x before 2.1.3. Attributes that have
  URI values weren't properly sanitized if the values contained character entities.
  Using character entities, it was possible to construct a URI value with a scheme
  that was not allowed that would slide through unsanitized.
