package:
  name: cryptography
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: A flaw was found in python-cryptography versions between >=1.9.0 and <2.3.
  The finalize_with_tag API did not enforce a minimum tag length. If a user did not
  validate the input length prior to passing it to finalize_with_tag an attacker could
  craft an invalid payload with a shortened tag (e.g. 1 byte) such that they would
  have a 1 in 256 chance of passing the MAC check. GCM tag forgeries can cause key
  leakage.
