aliases:
- CVE-2023-49083
- GHSA-jfhm-5ghh-2f97
details: cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and
  recipes to Python developers. Calling `load_pem_pkcs7_certificates` or `load_der_pkcs7_certificates`
  could lead to a NULL-pointer dereference and segfault. Exploitation of this vulnerability
  poses a serious risk of Denial of Service (DoS) for any application attempting to
  deserialize a PKCS7 blob/certificate. The consequences extend to potential disruptions
  in system availability and stability. This vulnerability has been patched in version
  41.0.6.
