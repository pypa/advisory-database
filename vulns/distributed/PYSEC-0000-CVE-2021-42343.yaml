id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-42343
details: An issue was discovered in the Dask distributed package before 2021.10.0
  for Python. Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster
  or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly
  configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically
  with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster
  created using this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable port
  exposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.
