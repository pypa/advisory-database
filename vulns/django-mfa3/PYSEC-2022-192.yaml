details: 'django-mfa3 is a library that implements multi factor authentication for
  the django web framework. It achieves this by modifying the regular login view.
  Django however has a second login view for its admin area. This second login view
  was not modified, so the multi factor authentication can be bypassed. Users are
  affected if they have activated both django-mfa3 (< 0.5.0) and django.contrib.admin
  and have not taken any other measures to prevent users from accessing the admin
  login view. The issue has been fixed in django-mfa3 0.5.0. It is possible to work
  around the issue by overwriting the admin login route, e.g. by adding the following
  URL definition *before* the admin routes: url(''admin/login/'', lambda request:
  redirect(settings.LOGIN_URL)'
