id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2017-12794
package:
  name: django
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: In Django 1.10.x before 1.10.8 and 1.11.x before 1.11.5, HTML autoescaping
  was disabled in a portion of the template for the technical 500 debug page. Given
  the right circumstances, this allowed a cross-site scripting attack. This vulnerability
  shouldn't affect most production sites since you shouldn't run with "DEBUG = True"
  (which makes this page accessible) in your production settings.

    introduced: '1.10'
