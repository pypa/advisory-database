id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2014-5277
package:
  name: docker-py
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: Docker before 1.3.1 and docker-py before 0.5.3 fall back to HTTP when the
  HTTPS connection to the registry fails, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers
  to conduct downgrade attacks and obtain authentication and image data by leveraging
  a network position between the client and the registry to block HTTPS traffic.
