details: 'An issue was discovered in drf-jwt 1.15.x before 1.15.1. It allows attackers
  with access to a notionally invalidated token to obtain a new, working token via
  the refresh endpoint, because the blacklist protection mechanism is incompatible
  with the token-refresh feature. NOTE: drf-jwt is a fork of jpadilla/django-rest-framework-jwt,
  which is unmaintained.'
