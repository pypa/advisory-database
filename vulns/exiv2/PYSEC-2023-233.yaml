id: PYSEC-2023-233
details: Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, delete
  and modify Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. An out-of-bounds write was found
  in Exiv2 version v0.28.0. The vulnerable function, `BmffImage::brotliUncompress`,
  is new in v0.28.0, so earlier versions of Exiv2 are _not_ affected. The out-of-bounds
  write is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted image file.
  An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution,
  if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. This bug
  is fixed in version v0.28.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability.
