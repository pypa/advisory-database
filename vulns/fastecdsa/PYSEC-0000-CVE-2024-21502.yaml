id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-21502
details: Versions of the package fastecdsa before 2.3.2 are vulnerable to Use of Uninitialized
  Variable on the stack, via the curvemath_mul function in src/curveMath.c, due to
  being used and interpreted as user-defined type. Depending on the variable's actual
  value it could be arbitrary free(), arbitrary realloc(), null pointer dereference
  and other. Since the stack can be controlled by the attacker, the vulnerability
  could be used to corrupt allocator structure, leading to possible heap exploitation.
  The attacker could cause denial of service by exploiting this vulnerability.
