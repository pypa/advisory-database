  name: fastecdsa
  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: Vulnerability in fastecdsa
details: An issue was discovered in fastecdsa before 2.1.2. When using the NIST P-256
  curve in the ECDSA implementation, the point at infinity is mishandled. This means
  that for an extreme value in k and s^-1, the signature verification fails even if
  the signature is correct. This behavior is not solely a usability problem. There
  are some threat models where an attacker can benefit by successfully guessing users
  for whom signature verification will fail.
