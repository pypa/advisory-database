id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-32805
details: Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework, built on top of
  Flask. In affected versions if using Flask-AppBuilder OAuth, an attacker can share
  a carefully crafted URL with a trusted domain for an application built with Flask-AppBuilder,
  this URL can redirect a user to a malicious site. This is an open redirect vulnerability.
  To resolve this issue upgrade to Flask-AppBuilder 3.2.2 or above. If upgrading is
  infeasible users may filter HTTP traffic containing `?next={next-site}` where the
  `next-site` domain is different from the application you are protecting as a workaround.
