id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-23401
details: This affects all versions of package Flask-User. When using the make_safe_url
  function, it is possible to bypass URL validation and redirect a user to an arbitrary
  URL by providing multiple back slashes such as /////evil.com/path or \\\evil.com/path.
  This vulnerability is only exploitable if an alternative WSGI server other than
  Werkzeug is used, or the default behaviour of Werkzeug is modified using 'autocorrect_location_header=False.
