id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-24770
details: '`gradio` is an open source framework for building interactive machine learning
  models and demos. Prior to version 2.8.11, `gradio` suffers from Improper Neutralization
  of Formula Elements in a CSV File. The `gradio` library has a flagging functionality
  which saves input/output data into a CSV file on the developer''s computer. This
  can allow a user to save arbitrary text into the CSV file, such as commands. If
  a program like MS Excel opens such a file, then it automatically runs these commands,
  which could lead to arbitrary commands running on the user''s computer. The problem
  has been patched as of `2.8.11`, which escapes the saved csv with single quotes.
  As a workaround, avoid opening csv files generated by `gradio` with Excel or similar
  spreadsheet programs.'
