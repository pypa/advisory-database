package:
  name: hpack
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: A HTTP/2 implementation built using any version of the Python HPACK library
  between v1.0.0 and v2.2.0 could be targeted for a denial of service attack, specifically
  a so-called "HPACK Bomb" attack. This attack occurs when an attacker inserts a header
  field that is exactly the size of the HPACK dynamic header table into the dynamic
  header table. The attacker can then send a header block that is simply repeated
  requests to expand that field in the dynamic table. This can lead to a gigantic
  compression ratio of 4,096 or better, meaning that 16kB of data can decompress to
  64MB of data on the target machine.
