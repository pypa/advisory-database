id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-32076
details: in-toto is a framework to protect supply chain integrity. The in-toto configuration
  is read from various directories and allows users to configure the behavior of the
  framework. The files are from directories following the XDG base directory specification.
  In versions 1.4.0 and prior, among the files read is `.in_totorc` which is a hidden
  file in the directory in which in-toto is run. If an attacker controls the inputs
  to a supply chain step, they can mask their activities by also passing in an `.in_totorc`
  file that includes the necessary exclude patterns and settings. RC files are widely
  used in other systems and security issues have been discovered in their implementations
  as well. Maintainers found in their conversations with in-toto adopters that `in_totorc`
  is not their preferred way to configure in-toto. As none of the options supported
  in `in_totorc` is unique, and can be set elsewhere using API parameters or CLI arguments,
  the maintainers decided to drop support for `in_totorc`. in-toto's `user_settings`
  module has been dropped altogether in commit 3a21d84f40811b7d191fa7bd17265c1f99599afd.
  Users may also sandbox functionary code as a security measure.
