id: PYSEC-2020-48
package:
  name: indy-node
  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: Vulnerability in indy-node
details: Hyperledger Indy Node is the server portion of a distributed ledger purpose-built
  for decentralized identity. In Hyperledger Indy before version 1.12.4, there is
  lack of signature verification on a specific transaction which enables an attacker
  to make certain unauthorized alterations to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym
  transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed,
  regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no particular role can ask an update
  for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role). This is bad because 1) Any
  DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID can spam the ledger
  with nym transactions), 2) Any DID can change any other DID's alias, 3) The update
  transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID.
