id: PYSEC-2021-836
details: Invenio-Drafts-Resources is a submission/deposit module for Invenio, a software
  framework for research data management. Invenio-Drafts-Resources prior to versions
  0.13.7 and 0.14.6 does not properly check permissions when a record is published.
  The vulnerability is exploitable in a default installation of InvenioRDM. An authenticated
  a user is able via REST API calls to publish draft records of other users if they
  know the record identifier and the draft validates (e.g. all require fields filled
  out). An attacker is not able to modify the data in the record, and thus e.g. *cannot*
  change a record from restricted to public. The problem is patched in Invenio-Drafts-Resources
  v0.13.7 and 0.14.6, which is part of InvenioRDM v6.0.1 and InvenioRDM v7.0 respectively.
