id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-24798
details: Internet Routing Registry daemon version 4 is an IRR database server, processing
  IRR objects in the RPSL format. IRRd did not always filter password hashes in query
  responses relating to `mntner` objects and database exports. This may have allowed
  adversaries to retrieve some of these hashes, perform a brute-force search for the
  clear-text passphrase, and use these to make unauthorised changes to affected IRR
  objects. This issue only affected instances that process password hashes, which
  means it is limited to IRRd instances that serve authoritative databases. IRRd instances
  operating solely as mirrors of other IRR databases are not affected. This has been
  fixed in IRRd 4.2.3 and the main branch. Versions in the 4.1.x series never were
  affected. Users of the 4.2.x series are strongly recommended to upgrade. There are
  no known workarounds for this issue.
