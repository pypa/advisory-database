id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2020-26232
package:
  name: jupyter-server
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: Jupyter Server before version 1.0.6 has an Open redirect vulnerability. A
  maliciously crafted link to a jupyter server could redirect the browser to a different
  website. All jupyter servers are technically affected, however, these maliciously
  crafted links can only be reasonably made for known jupyter server hosts. A link
  to your jupyter server may appear safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server
  on the public internet.
