id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-32797
package:
  name: jupyterlab
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: JupyterLab is a user interface for Project Jupyter which will eventually
  replace the classic Jupyter Notebook. In affected versions untrusted notebook can
  execute code on load. In particular JupyterLab doesnâ€™t sanitize the action attribute
  of html `<form>`. Using this it is possible to trigger the form validation outside
  of the form itself. This is a remote code execution, but requires user action to
  open a notebook.
