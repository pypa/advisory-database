id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-21513
details: "Versions of the package langchain-experimental from 0.0.15 and before 0.0.21
  are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution when retrieving values from the database,
  the code will attempt to call 'eval' on all values. An attacker can exploit this
  vulnerability and execute arbitrary python code if they can control the input prompt
  and the server is configured with VectorSQLDatabaseChain.\r\r**Notes:**\r\rImpact
  on the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of the vulnerable component:\r\rConfidentiality:
  Code execution happens within the impacted component, in this case langchain-experimental,
  so all resources are necessarily accessible.\r\rIntegrity: There is nothing protected
  by the impacted component inherently. Although anything returned from the component
  counts as 'information' for which the trustworthiness can be compromised.\r\rAvailability:
  The loss of availability isn't caused by the attack itself, but it happens as a
  result during the attacker's post-exploitation steps.\r\r\rImpact on the Confidentiality,
  Integrity and Availability of the subsequent system:\r\rAs a legitimate low-privileged
  user of the package (PR:L) the attacker does not have more access to data owned
  by the package as a result of this vulnerability than they did with normal usage
  (e.g. can query the DB). The unintended action that one can perform by breaking
  out of the app environment and exfiltrating files, making remote connections etc.
  happens during the post exploitation phase in the subsequent system - in this case,
  the OS.\r\rAT:P: An attacker needs to be able to influence the input prompt, whilst
  the server is configured with the VectorSQLDatabaseChain plugin."
