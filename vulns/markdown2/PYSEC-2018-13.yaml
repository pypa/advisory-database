details: An issue was discovered in markdown2 (aka python-markdown2) through 2.3.5.
  The safe_mode feature, which is supposed to sanitize user input against XSS, is
  flawed and does not escape the input properly. With a crafted payload, XSS can be
  triggered, as demonstrated by omitting the final '>' character from an IMG tag.
