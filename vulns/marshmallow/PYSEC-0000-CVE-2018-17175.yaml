id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2018-17175
package:
  name: marshmallow
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: In the marshmallow library before 2.15.1 and 3.x before 3.0.0b9 for Python,
  the schema "only" option treats an empty list as implying no "only" option, which
  allows a request that was intended to expose no fields to instead expose all fields
  (if the schema is being filtered dynamically using the "only" option, and there
  is a user role that produces an empty value for "only").
affects:
  ranges:
  - type: ECOSYSTEM
