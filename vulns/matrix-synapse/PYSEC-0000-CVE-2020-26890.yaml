id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2020-26890
package:
  name: matrix-synapse
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: Matrix Synapse before 1.20.0 erroneously permits non-standard NaN, Infinity,
  and -Infinity JSON values in fields of m.room.member events, allowing remote attackers
  to execute a denial of service attack against the federation and common Matrix clients.
  If such a malformed event is accepted into the room's state, the impact is long-lasting
  and is not fixed by an upgrade to a newer version, requiring the event to be manually
  redacted instead. Since events are replicated to servers of other room members,
  the impact is not constrained to the server of the event sender.
affects:
  ranges:
  - type: ECOSYSTEM
    fixed: 1.20.0
