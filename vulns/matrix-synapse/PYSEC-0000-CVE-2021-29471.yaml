id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-29471
package:
  name: matrix-synapse
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package
  matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and
  VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.33.2 "Push rules" can specify conditions under
  which they will match, including `event_match`, which matches event content against
  a pattern including wildcards. Certain patterns can cause very poor performance
  in the matching engine, leading to a denial-of-service when processing moderate
  length events. The issue is patched in version 1.33.2. A potential workaround might
  be to prevent users from making custom push rules, by blocking such requests at
  a reverse-proxy.
