id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-31152
details: Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the
  Matrix.org Foundation. The Matrix specification specifies a list of [event authorization
  rules](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.2/rooms/v9/#authorization-rules) which must be
  checked when determining if an event should be accepted into a room. In versions
  of Synapse up to and including version 1.61.0, some of these rules are not correctly
  applied. An attacker could craft events which would be accepted by Synapse but not
  a spec-conformant server, potentially causing divergence in the room state between
  servers. Administrators of homeservers with federation enabled are advised to upgrade
  to version 1.62.0 or higher. Federation can be disabled by setting [`federation_domain_whitelist`](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html#federation_domain_whitelist)
  to an empty list (`[]`) as a workaround.
