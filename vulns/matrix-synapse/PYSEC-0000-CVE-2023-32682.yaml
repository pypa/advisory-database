id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-32682
details: 'Synapse is a Matrix protocol homeserver written in Python with the Twisted
  framework. In affected versions it may be possible for a deactivated user to login
  when using uncommon configurations. This only applies if any of the following are
  true: 1. JSON Web Tokens are enabled for login via the `jwt_config.enabled` configuration
  setting. 2. The local password database is enabled via the `password_config.enabled`
  and `password_config.localdb_enabled` configuration settings *and* a user''s password
  is updated via an admin API after a user is deactivated. Note that the local password
  database is enabled by default, but it is uncommon to set a user''s password after
  they''ve been deactivated. Installations that are configured to only allow login
  via Single Sign-On (SSO) via CAS, SAML or OpenID Connect (OIDC); or via an external
  password provider (e.g. LDAP) are not affected. If not using JSON Web Tokens, ensure
  that deactivated users do not have a password set. This issue has been addressed
  in version 1.85.0. Users are advised to upgrade.'
