  name: matrix-synapse
  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: Vulnerability in matrix-synapse
details: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package
  matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and
  VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.28.0 Synapse is missing input validation of some
  parameters on the endpoints used to confirm third-party identifiers could cause
  excessive use of disk space and memory leading to resource exhaustion. Note that
  the groups feature is not part of the Matrix specification and the chosen maximum
  lengths are arbitrary. Not all clients might abide by them. Refer to referenced
  GitHub security advisory for additional details including workarounds.
