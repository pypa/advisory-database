id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-34457
details: MechanicalSoup is a Python library for automating interaction with websites.
  Starting in version 0.2.0 and prior to version 1.3.0, a malicious web server can
  read arbitrary files on the client using a `<input type="file" ...>` inside HTML
  form. All users of MechanicalSoup's form submission are affected, unless they took
  very specific (and manual) steps to reset HTML form field values. Version 1.3.0
  contains a patch for this issue.
