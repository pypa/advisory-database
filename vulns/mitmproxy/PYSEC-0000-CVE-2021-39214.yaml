id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-39214
details: mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. In mitmproxy
  7.0.2 and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform HTTP request smuggling
  attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server could smuggle
  a request/response through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP
  message body. While a smuggled request is still captured as part of another request's
  body, it does not appear in the request list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy
  event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access control checks or input
  sanitization. Unless one uses mitmproxy to protect an HTTP/1 service, no action
  is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy 7.0.3 and above.
