id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-21401
details: Nanopb is a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation in ansi C. In
  Nanopb before versions 0.3.9.8 and 0.4.5, decoding a specifically formed message
  can cause invalid `free()` or `realloc()` calls if the message type contains an
  `oneof` field, and the `oneof` directly contains both a pointer field and a non-pointer
  field. If the message data first contains the non-pointer field and then the pointer
  field, the data of the non-pointer field is incorrectly treated as if it was a pointer
  value. Such message data rarely occurs in normal messages, but it is a concern when
  untrusted data is parsed. This has been fixed in versions 0.3.9.8 and 0.4.5. See
  referenced GitHub Security Advisory for more information including workarounds.
