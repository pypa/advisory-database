id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-41134
details: nbdime provides tools for diffing and merging of Jupyter Notebooks. In affected
  versions a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue exists within the Jupyter-owned
  nbdime project. It appears that when reading the file name and path from disk, the
  extension does not sanitize the string it constructs before returning it to be displayed.
  The diffNotebookCheckpoint function within nbdime causes this issue. When attempting
  to display the name of the local notebook (diffNotebookCheckpoint), nbdime appears
  to simply append .ipynb to the name of the input file. The NbdimeWidget is then
  created, and the base string is passed through to the request API function. From
  there, the frontend simply renders the HTML tag and anything along with it. Users
  are advised to patch to the most recent version of the affected product.
