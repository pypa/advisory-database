id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2019-10876
package:
  name: neutron
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: An issue was discovered in OpenStack Neutron 11.x before 11.0.7, 12.x before
  12.0.6, and 13.x before 13.0.3. By creating two security groups with separate/overlapping
  port ranges, an authenticated user may prevent Neutron from being able to configure
  networks on any compute nodes where those security groups are present, because of
  an Open vSwitch (OVS) firewall KeyError. All Neutron deployments utilizing neutron-openvswitch-agent
  are affected.
