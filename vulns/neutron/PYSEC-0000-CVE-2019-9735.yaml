id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2019-9735
package:
  name: neutron
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: An issue was discovered in the iptables firewall module in OpenStack Neutron
  before 10.0.8, 11.x before 11.0.7, 12.x before 12.0.6, and 13.x before 13.0.3. By
  setting a destination port in a security group rule along with a protocol that doesn't
  support that option (for example, VRRP), an authenticated user may block further
  application of security group rules for instances from any project/tenant on the
  compute hosts to which it's applied. (Only deployments using the iptables security
  group driver are affected.)
