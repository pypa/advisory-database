id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-20267
package:
  name: neutron
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: 'A flaw was found in openstack-neutron''s default Open vSwitch firewall rules.
  By sending carefully crafted packets, anyone in control of a server instance connected
  to the virtual switch can impersonate the IPv6 addresses of other systems on the
  network, resulting in denial of service or in some cases possibly interception of
  traffic intended for other destinations. Only deployments using the Open vSwitch
  driver are affected. Source: OpenStack project. Versions before openstack-neutron
  15.3.3, openstack-neutron 16.3.1 and openstack-neutron 17.1.1 are affected.'
