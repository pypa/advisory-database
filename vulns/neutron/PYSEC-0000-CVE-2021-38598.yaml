id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-38598
details: OpenStack Neutron before 16.4.1, 17.x before 17.1.3, and 18.0.0 allows hardware
  address impersonation when the linuxbridge driver with ebtables-nft is used on a
  Netfilter-based platform. By sending carefully crafted packets, anyone in control
  of a server instance connected to the virtual switch can impersonate the hardware
  addresses of other systems on the network, resulting in denial of service or in
  some cases possibly interception of traffic intended for other destinations.
