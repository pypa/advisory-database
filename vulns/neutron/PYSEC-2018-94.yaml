package:
  name: neutron
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: Live-migrated instances are briefly able to inspect traffic for other instances
  on the same hypervisor. This brief window could be extended indefinitely if the
  instance's port is set administratively down prior to live-migration and kept down
  after the migration is complete. This is possible due to the Open vSwitch integration
  bridge being connected to the instance during migration. When connected to the integration
  bridge, all traffic for instances using the same Open vSwitch instance would potentially
  be visible to the migrated guest, as the required Open vSwitch VLAN filters are
  only applied post-migration. Versions of openstack-neutron before 13.0.0.0b2, 12.0.3,
  11.0.5 are vulnerable.
