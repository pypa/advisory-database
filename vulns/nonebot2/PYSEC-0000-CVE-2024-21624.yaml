id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-21624
details: 'nonebot2 is a cross-platform Python asynchronous chatbot framework written
  in Python. This security advisory pertains to a potential information leak (e.g.,
  environment variables) in instances where developers utilize `MessageTemplate` and
  incorporate user-provided data into templates. The identified vulnerability has
  been remedied in pull request #2509 and will be included in versions released from
  2.2.0. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to these patched versions to safeguard
  against the vulnerability. A temporary workaround involves filtering underscores
  before incorporating user input into the message template.'
