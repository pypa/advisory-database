details: The Jupyter notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive
  computing. In affected versions untrusted notebook can execute code on load. Jupyter
  Notebook uses a deprecated version of Google Caja to sanitize user inputs. A public
  Caja bypass can be used to trigger an XSS when a victim opens a malicious ipynb
  document in Jupyter Notebook. The XSS allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code
  on the victim computer using Jupyter APIs.
