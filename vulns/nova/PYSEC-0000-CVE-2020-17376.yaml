id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2020-17376
package:
  name: nova
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: An issue was discovered in Guest.migrate in virt/libvirt/guest.py in OpenStack
  Nova before 19.3.1, 20.x before 20.3.1, and 21.0.0. By performing a soft reboot
  of an instance that has previously undergone live migration, a user may gain access
  to destination host devices that share the same paths as host devices previously
  referenced by the virtual machine on the source host. This can include block devices
  that map to different Cinder volumes at the destination than at the source. Only
  deployments allowing host-based connections (for instance, root and ephemeral devices)
  are affected.
