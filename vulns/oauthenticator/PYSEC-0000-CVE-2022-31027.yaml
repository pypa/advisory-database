id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-31027
details: OAuthenticator is an OAuth token library for the JupyerHub login handler.
  CILogonOAuthenticator is provided by the OAuthenticator package, and lets users
  log in to a JupyterHub via CILogon. This is primarily used to restrict a JupyterHub
  only to users of a given institute. The allowed_idps configuration trait of CILogonOAuthenticator
  is documented to be a list of domains that indicate the institutions whose users
  are authorized to access this JupyterHub. This authorization is validated by ensuring
  that the *email* field provided to us by CILogon has a *domain* that matches one
  of the domains listed in `allowed_idps`.If `allowed_idps` contains `berkeley.edu`,
  you might expect only users with valid current credentials provided by University
  of California, Berkeley to be able to access the JupyterHub. However, CILogonOAuthenticator
  does *not* verify which provider is used by the user to login, only the email address
  provided. So a user can login with a GitHub account that has email set to `<something>@berkeley.edu`,
  and that will be treated exactly the same as someone logging in using the UC Berkeley
  official Identity Provider. The patch fixing this issue makes a *breaking change*
  in how `allowed_idps` is interpreted. It's no longer a list of domains, but configuration
  representing the `EntityID` of the IdPs that are allowed, picked from the [list
  maintained by CILogon](https://cilogon.org/idplist/). Users are advised to upgrade.
