id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2019-3895
package:
  name: octavia
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: An access-control flaw was found in the Octavia service when the cloud platform
  was deployed using Red Hat OpenStack Platform Director. An attacker could cause
  new amphorae to run based on any arbitrary image. This meant that a remote attacker
  could upload a new amphorae image and, if requested to spawn new amphorae, Octavia
  would then pick up the compromised image.
