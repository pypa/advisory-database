id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-41132
details: OMERO.web provides a web based client and plugin infrastructure. In versions
  prior to 5.11.0, a variety of templates do not perform proper sanitization through
  HTML escaping. Due to the lack of sanitization and use of ``jQuery.html()``, there
  are a whole host of cross-site scripting possibilities with specially crafted input
  to a variety of fields. This issue is patched in version 5.11.0. There are no known
  workarounds aside from upgrading.
