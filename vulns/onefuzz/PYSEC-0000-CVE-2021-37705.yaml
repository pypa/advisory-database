id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-37705
details: OneFuzz is an open source self-hosted Fuzzing-As-A-Service platform. Starting
  with OneFuzz 2.12.0 or greater, an incomplete authorization check allows an authenticated
  user from any Azure Active Directory tenant to make authorized API calls to a vulnerable
  OneFuzz instance. To be vulnerable, a OneFuzz deployment must be both version 2.12.0
  or greater and deployed with the non-default --multi_tenant_domain option. This
  can result in read/write access to private data such as software vulnerability and
  crash information, security testing tools and proprietary code and symbols. Via
  authorized API calls, this also enables tampering with existing data and unauthorized
  code execution on Azure compute resources. This issue is resolved starting in release
  2.31.0, via the addition of application-level check of the bearer token's `issuer`
  against an administrator-configured allowlist. As a workaround users can restrict
  access to the tenant of a deployed OneFuzz instance < 2.31.0 by redeploying in the
  default configuration, which omits the `--multi_tenant_domain` option.
