id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-21688
details: OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously
  share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. Affected
  versions of the desktop application were found to be vulnerable to denial of service
  via an undisclosed vulnerability in the QT image parsing. Roughly 20 bytes lead
  to 2GB memory consumption and this can be triggered multiple times. To be abused,
  this vulnerability requires rendering in the history tab, so some user interaction
  is required. An adversary with knowledge of the Onion service address in public
  mode or with authentication in private mode can perform a Denial of Service attack,
  which quickly results in out-of-memory for the server. This requires the desktop
  application with rendered history, therefore the impact is only elevated. This issue
  has been patched in version 2.5.
