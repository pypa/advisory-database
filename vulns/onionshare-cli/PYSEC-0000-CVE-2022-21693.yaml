id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-21693
details: OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously
  share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In affected
  versions an adversary with a primitive that allows for filesystem access from the
  context of the Onionshare process can access sensitive files in the entire user
  home folder. This could lead to the leaking of sensitive data. Due to the automatic
  exclusion of hidden folders, the impact is reduced. This can be mitigated by usage
  of the flatpak release.
