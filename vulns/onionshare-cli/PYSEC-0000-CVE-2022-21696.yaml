id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-21696
details: OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously
  share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In affected
  versions it is possible to change the username to that of another chat participant

  by adding whitespace characters at the end of the username.
