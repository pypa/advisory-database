id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-31124
details: openssh_key_parser is an open source Python package providing utilities to
  parse and pack OpenSSH private and public key files. In versions prior to 0.0.6
  if a field of a key is shorter than it is declared to be, the parser raises an error
  with a message containing the raw field value. An attacker able to modify the declared
  length of a key's sensitive field can thus expose the raw value of that field. Users
  are advised to upgrade to version 0.0.6, which no longer includes the raw field
  value in the error message. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
