id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-23940
details: OpenZeppelin Contracts for Cairo is a library for secure smart contract development
  written in Cairo for StarkNet, a decentralized ZK Rollup. `is_valid_eth_signature`
  is missing a call to `finalize_keccak` after calling `verify_eth_signature`. As
  a result, any contract using `is_valid_eth_signature` from the account library (such
  as the `EthAccount` preset) is vulnerable to a malicious sequencer. Specifically,
  the malicious sequencer would be able to bypass signature validation to impersonate
  an instance of these accounts. The issue has been patched in 0.6.1.
