id: PYSEC-2020-74
details: Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Papermerge before
  1.5.2 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the rename,
  tag, upload, or create folder function. The payload can be in a folder, a tag, or
  a document's filename. If email consumption is configured in Papermerge, a malicious
  document can be sent by email and is automatically uploaded into the Papermerge
  web application. Therefore, no authentication is required to exploit XSS if email
  consumption is configured. Otherwise authentication is required.
