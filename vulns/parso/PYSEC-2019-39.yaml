summary: Vulnerability in parso
details: '** DISPUTED ** A deserialization vulnerability exists in the way parso through
  0.4.0 handles grammar parsing from the cache. Cache loading relies on pickle and,
  provided that an evil pickle can be written to a cache grammar file and that its
  parsing can be triggered, this flaw leads to Arbitrary Code Execution. NOTE: This
  is disputed because "the cache directory is not under control of the attacker in
  any common configuration."'
