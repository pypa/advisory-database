id: PYSEC-2022-42997
details: Passeo is an open source python password generator. Versions prior to 1.0.5
  rely on the python `random` library for random value selection. The python `random`
  library warns that it should not be used for security purposes due to its reliance
  on a non-cryptographically secure random number generator. As a result a motivated
  attacker may be able to guess generated passwords. This issue has been addressed
  in version 1.0.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
  this vulnerability.
