id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-21668
details: pipenv is a Python development workflow tool. Starting with version 2018.10.9
  and prior to version 2022.1.8, a flaw in pipenv's parsing of requirements files
  allows an attacker to insert a specially crafted string inside a comment anywhere
  within a requirements.txt file, which will cause victims who use pipenv to install
  the requirements file to download dependencies from a package index server controlled
  by the attacker. By embedding malicious code in packages served from their malicious
  index server, the attacker can trigger arbitrary remote code execution (RCE) on
  the victims' systems. If an attacker is able to hide a malicious `--index-url` option
  in a requirements file that a victim installs with pipenv, the attacker can embed
  arbitrary malicious code in packages served from their malicious index server that
  will be executed on the victim's host during installation (remote code execution/RCE).
  When pip installs from a source distribution, any code in the setup.py is executed
  by the install process. This issue is patched in version 2022.1.8. The GitHub Security
  Advisory contains more information about this vulnerability.
