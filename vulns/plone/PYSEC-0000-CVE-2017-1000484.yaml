id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2017-1000484
package:
  name: plone
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: 'By linking to a specific url in Plone 2.5-5.1rc1 with a parameter, an attacker
  could send you to his own website. On its own this is not so bad: the attacker could
  more easily link directly to his own website instead. But in combination with another
  attack, you could be sent to the Plone login form and login, then get redirected
  to the specific url, and then get a second redirect to the attacker website. (The
  specific url can be seen by inspecting the hotfix code, but we don''t want to make
  it too easy for attackers by spelling it out here.)'
