id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-36069
details: Poetry is a dependency manager for Python. When handling dependencies that
  come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Poetry uses various commands,
  such as `git clone`. These commands are constructed using user input (e.g. the repository
  URL). When building the commands, Poetry correctly avoids Command Injection vulnerabilities
  by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is
  the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated
  as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution
  because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary
  executables. If a developer is exploited, the attacker could steal credentials or
  persist their access. If the exploit happens on a server, the attackers could use
  their access to attack other internal systems. Since this vulnerability requires
  a fair amount of user interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely exploitable
  one. However, it still puts developers at risk when dealing with untrusted files
  in a way they think is safe, because the exploit still works when the victim tries
  to make sure nothing can happen, e.g. by vetting any Git or Poetry config files
  that might be present in the directory. Versions 1.1.9 and 1.2.0b1 contain patches
  for this issue.
