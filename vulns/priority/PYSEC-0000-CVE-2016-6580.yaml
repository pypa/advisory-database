id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2016-6580
package:
  name: priority
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: A HTTP/2 implementation built using any version of the Python priority library
  prior to version 1.2.0 could be targeted by a malicious peer by having that peer
  assign priority information for every possible HTTP/2 stream ID. The priority tree
  would happily continue to store the priority information for each stream, and would
  therefore allocate unbounded amounts of memory. Attempting to actually use a tree
  like this would also cause extremely high CPU usage to maintain the tree.
affects:
  ranges: 
  - type: ECOSYSTEM
    fixed: 1.2.0
