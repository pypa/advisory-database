id: PYSEC-2017-93
details: A HTTP/2 implementation built using any version of the Python priority library
  prior to version 1.2.0 could be targeted by a malicious peer by having that peer
  assign priority information for every possible HTTP/2 stream ID. The priority tree
  would happily continue to store the priority information for each stream, and would
  therefore allocate unbounded amounts of memory. Attempting to actually use a tree
  like this would also cause extremely high CPU usage to maintain the tree.
