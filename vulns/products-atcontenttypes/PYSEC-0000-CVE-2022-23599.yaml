id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-23599
details: Products.ATContentTypes are the core content types for Plone 2.1 - 4.3. Versions
  of Plone that are dependent on Products.ATContentTypes prior to version 3.0.6 are
  vulnerable to reflected cross site scripting and open redirect when an attacker
  can get a compromised version of the image_view_fullscreen page in a cache, for
  example in Varnish. The technique is known as cache poisoning. Any later visitor
  can get redirected when clicking on a link on this page. Usually only anonymous
  users are affected, but this depends on the user's cache settings. Version 3.0.6
  of Products.ATContentTypes has been released with a fix. This version works on Plone
  5.2, Python 2 only. As a workaround, make sure the image_view_fullscreen page is
  not stored in the cache. More information about the vulnerability and cvmitigation
  measures is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.
