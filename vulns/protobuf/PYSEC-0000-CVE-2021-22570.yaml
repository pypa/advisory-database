id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-22570
details: Nullptr dereference when a null char is present in a proto symbol. The symbol
  is parsed incorrectly, leading to an unchecked call into the proto file's name during
  generation of the resulting error message. Since the symbol is incorrectly parsed,
  the file is nullptr. We recommend upgrading to version 3.15.0 or greater.
