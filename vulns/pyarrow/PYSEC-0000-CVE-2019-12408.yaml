id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2019-12408
package:
  name: pyarrow
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: It was discovered that the C++ implementation (which underlies the R, Python
  and Ruby implementations) of Apache Arrow 0.14.0 to 0.14.1 had a uninitialized memory
  bug when building arrays with null values in some cases. This can lead to uninitialized
  memory being unintentionally shared if Arrow Arrays are transmitted over the wire
  (for instance with Flight) or persisted in the streaming IPC and file formats.
affects:
  ranges:
  - type: ECOSYSTEM
