package:
  name: pydantic
  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: Vulnerability in pydantic
details: 'Pydantic is a data validation and settings management using Python type
  hinting. In affected versions passing either `''infinity''`, `''inf''` or `float(''inf'')`
  (or their negatives) to `datetime` or `date` fields causes validation to run forever
  with 100% CPU usage (on one CPU). Pydantic has been patched with fixes available
  in the following versions: v1.8.2, v1.7.4, v1.6.2. All these versions are available
  on pypi(https://pypi.org/project/pydantic/#history), and will be available on conda-forge(https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pydantic)
  soon. See the changelog(https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) for details. If you
  absolutely can''t upgrade, you can work around this risk using a validator(https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/validators/)
  to catch these values. This is not an ideal solution (in particular you''ll need
  a slightly different function for datetimes), instead of a hack like this you should
  upgrade pydantic. If you are not using v1.8.x, v1.7.x or v1.6.x and are unable to
  upgrade to a fixed version of pydantic, please create an issue at https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues
  requesting a back-port, and we will endeavour to release a patch for earlier versions
  of pydantic.'
