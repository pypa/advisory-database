id: PYSEC-2020-175
details: 'In PyInstaller before version 3.6, only on Windows, a local privilege escalation
  vulnerability is present in this particular case: If a software using PyInstaller
  in "onefile" mode is launched by a privileged user (at least more than the current
  one) which have his "TempPath" resolving to a world writable directory. This is
  the case for example if the software is launched as a service or as a scheduled
  task using a system account (TempPath will be C:\Windows\Temp). In order to be exploitable
  the software has to be (re)started after the attacker launch the exploit program,
  so for a service launched at startup, a service restart is needed (e.g. after a
  crash or an upgrade).'
