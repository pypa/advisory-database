details: A code injection issue was discovered in PyXDG before 0.26 via crafted Python
  code in a Category element of a Menu XML document in a .menu file. XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
  must be set up to trigger xdg.Menu.parse parsing within the directory containing
  this file. This is due to a lack of sanitization in xdg/Menu.py before an eval call.
