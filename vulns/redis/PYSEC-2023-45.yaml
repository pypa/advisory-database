id: PYSEC-2023-45
details: redis-py before 4.5.3, as used in ChatGPT and other products, leaves a connection
  open after canceling an async Redis command at an inopportune time (in the case
  of a pipeline operation), and can send response data to the client of an unrelated
  request in an off-by-one manner. The fixed versions for this CVE Record are 4.3.6,
  4.4.3, and 4.5.3; however, CVE-2023-28859 is a separate vulnerability.
