id: PYSEC-2020-99
details: Python-RSA before 4.1 ignores leading '\0' bytes during decryption of ciphertext.
  This could conceivably have a security-relevant impact, e.g., by helping an attacker
  to infer that an application uses Python-RSA, or if the length of accepted ciphertext
  affects application behavior (such as by causing excessive memory allocation).
