id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2017-14158
package:
  name: scrapy
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: Scrapy 1.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption)
  via large files because arbitrarily many files are read into memory, which is especially
  problematic if the files are then individually written in a separate thread to a
  slow storage resource, as demonstrated by interaction between dataReceived (in core/downloader/handlers/http11.py)
  and S3FilesStore.
