id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-41125
details: Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If
  you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes)
  for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request
  target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt`
  requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as
  requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain`
  spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured
  HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version,
  and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1
  instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request
  basis, using for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert
  your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header
  of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.
