id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-23485
details: Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. In versions
  of the sentry python library prior to 22.11.0 an attacker with a known valid invite
  link could manipulate a cookie to allow the same invite link to be reused on multiple
  accounts when joining an organization. As a result an attacker with a valid invite
  link can create multiple users and join an organization they may not have been originally
  invited to. This issue was patched in version 22.11.0. Sentry SaaS customers do
  not need to take action. Self-hosted Sentry installs on systems which can not upgrade
  can disable the invite functionality until they are ready to deploy the patched
  version by editing their `sentry.conf.py` file (usually located at `~/.sentry/`).
