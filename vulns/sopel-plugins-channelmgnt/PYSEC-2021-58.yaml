details: sopel-channelmgnt is a channelmgnt plugin for sopel. In versions prior to
  2.0.1, on some IRC servers, restrictions around the removal of the bot using the
  kick/kickban command could be bypassed when kicking multiple users at once. We also
  believe it may have been possible to remove users from other channels but due to
  the wonder that is IRC and following RfCs, We have no POC for that. Freenode is
  not affected. This is fixed in version 2.0.1. As a workaround, do not use this plugin
  on networks where TARGMAX > 1.
