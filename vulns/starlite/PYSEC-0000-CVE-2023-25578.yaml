id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-25578
details: Starlite is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework. Prior
  to version 1.5.2, the request body parsing in `starlite` allows a potentially unauthenticated
  attacker to consume a large amount of CPU time and RAM. The multipart body parser
  processes an unlimited number of file parts and an unlimited number of field parts.
  This is a remote, potentially unauthenticated Denial of Service vulnerability. This
  vulnerability affects applications with a request handler that accepts a `Body(media_type=RequestEncodingType.MULTI_PART)`.
  The large amount of CPU time required for processing requests can block all available
  worker processes and significantly delay or slow down the processing of legitimate
  user requests. The large amount of RAM accumulated while processing requests can
  lead to Out-Of-Memory kills. Complete DoS is achievable by sending many concurrent
  multipart requests in a loop. Version 1.51.2 contains a patch for this issue.
