id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-27494
details: Streamlit, software for turning data scripts into web applications, had a
  cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in versions 0.63.0 through 0.80.0. Users
  of hosted Streamlit app(s) were vulnerable to a reflected XSS vulnerability. An
  attacker could craft a malicious URL with Javascript payloads to a Streamlit app.
  The attacker could then trick the user into visiting the malicious URL and, if successful,
  the server would render the malicious javascript payload as-is, leading to XSS.
  Version 0.81.0 contains a patch for this vulnerability.
