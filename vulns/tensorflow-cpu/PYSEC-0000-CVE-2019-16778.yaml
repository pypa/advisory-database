details: In TensorFlow before 1.15, a heap buffer overflow in UnsortedSegmentSum can
  be produced when the Index template argument is int32. In this case data_size and
  num_segments fields are truncated from int64 to int32 and can produce negative numbers,
  resulting in accessing out of bounds heap memory. This is unlikely to be exploitable
  and was detected and fixed internally in TensorFlow 1.15 and 2.0.
