id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-29526
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An
  attacker can trigger a division by 0 in `tf.raw_ops.Conv2D`. This is because the
  implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/988087bd83f144af14087fe4fecee2d250d93737/tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_ops.cc#L261-L263)
  does a division by a quantity that is controlled by the caller. The fix will be
  included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also
  affected and still in supported range.
