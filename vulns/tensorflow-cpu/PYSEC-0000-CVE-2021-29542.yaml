details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An
  attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow by passing crafted inputs to `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams`.
  This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1cdd4da14282210cc759e468d9781741ac7d01bf/tensorflow/core/kernels/string_ngrams_op.cc#L171-L185)
  fails to consider corner cases where input would be split in such a way that the
  generated tokens should only contain padding elements. If input is such that `num_tokens`
  is 0, then, for `data_start_index=0` (when left padding is present), the marked
  line would result in reading `data[-1]`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3,
  TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range.
