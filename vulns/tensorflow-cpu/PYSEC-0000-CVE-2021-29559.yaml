- GHSA-59q2-x2qc-4c97
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An
  attacker can access data outside of bounds of heap allocated array in `tf.raw_ops.UnicodeEncode`.
  This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/472c1f12ad9063405737679d4f6bd43094e1d36d/tensorflow/core/kernels/unicode_ops.cc)
  assumes that the `input_value`/`input_splits` pair specify a valid sparse tensor.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as
  these are also affected and still in supported range.
