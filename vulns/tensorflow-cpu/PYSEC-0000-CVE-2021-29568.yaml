id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-29568
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An
  attacker can trigger undefined behavior by binding to null pointer in `tf.raw_ops.ParameterizedTruncatedNormal`.
  This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/3f6fe4dfef6f57e768260b48166c27d148f3015f/tensorflow/core/kernels/parameterized_truncated_normal_op.cc#L630)
  does not validate input arguments before accessing the first element of `shape`.
  If `shape` argument is empty, then `shape_tensor.flat<T>()` is an empty array. The
  fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on
  TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range.
