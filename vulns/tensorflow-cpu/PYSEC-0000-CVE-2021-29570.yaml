id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-29570
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The
  implementation of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGradWithArgmax` can cause reads outside of
  bounds of heap allocated data if attacker supplies specially crafted inputs. The
  implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/ef0c008ee84bad91ec6725ddc42091e19a30cf0e/tensorflow/core/kernels/maxpooling_op.cc#L1016-L1017)
  uses the same value to index in two different arrays but there is no guarantee that
  the sizes are identical. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also
  cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and
  TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
