details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. TFlite
  graphs must not have loops between nodes. However, this condition was not checked
  and an attacker could craft models that would result in infinite loop during evaluation.
  In certain cases, the infinite loop would be replaced by stack overflow due to too
  many recursive calls. For example, the `While` implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/106d8f4fb89335a2c52d7c895b7a7485465ca8d9/tensorflow/lite/kernels/while.cc)
  could be tricked into a scneario where both the body and the loop subgraphs are
  the same. Evaluating one of the subgraphs means calling the `Eval` function for
  the other and this quickly exhaust all stack space. The fix will be included in
  TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow
  2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range. Please consult our security guide(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md)
