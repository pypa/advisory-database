details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. TFLite's
  convolution code(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/09c73bca7d648e961dd05898292d91a8322a9d45/tensorflow/lite/kernels/conv.cc)
  has multiple division where the divisor is controlled by the user and not checked
  to be non-zero. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
  2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
