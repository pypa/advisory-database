aliases:
- CVE-2021-29596
- GHSA-4vrf-ff7v-hpgr
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The
  implementation of the `EmbeddingLookup` TFLite operator is vulnerable to a division
  by zero error(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e4b29809543b250bc9b19678ec4776299dd569ba/tensorflow/lite/kernels/embedding_lookup.cc#L73-L74).
  An attacker can craft a model such that the first dimension of the `value` input
  is 0. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
  commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range.
