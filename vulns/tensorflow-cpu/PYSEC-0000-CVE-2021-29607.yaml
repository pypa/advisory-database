- GHSA-gv26-jpj9-c8gq
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. Incomplete
  validation in `SparseAdd` results in allowing attackers to exploit undefined behavior
  (dereferencing null pointers) as well as write outside of bounds of heap allocated
  data. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/656e7673b14acd7835dc778867f84916c6d1cac2/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_sparse_binary_op_shared.cc)
  has a large set of validation for the two sparse tensor inputs (6 tensors in total),
  but does not validate that the tensors are not empty or that the second dimension
  of `*_indices` matches the size of corresponding `*_shape`. This allows attackers
  to send tensor triples that represent invalid sparse tensors to abuse code assumptions
  that are not protected by validation. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
  We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow
  2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
