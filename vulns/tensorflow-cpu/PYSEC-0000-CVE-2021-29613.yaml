aliases:

- GHSA-vvg4-vgrv-xfr7
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. Incomplete
  validation in `tf.raw_ops.CTCLoss` allows an attacker to trigger an OOB read from
  heap. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick these
  commits on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range.
