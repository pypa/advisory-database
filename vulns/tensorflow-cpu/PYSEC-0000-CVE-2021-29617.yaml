aliases:

- GHSA-mmq6-q8r3-48fm
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An
  attacker can cause a denial of service via `CHECK`-fail in `tf.strings.substr` with
  invalid arguments. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
  2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
