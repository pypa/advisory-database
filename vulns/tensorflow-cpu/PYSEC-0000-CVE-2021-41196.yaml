aliases:
- CVE-2021-41196
- GHSA-m539-j985-hcr8
details: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions
  the Keras pooling layers can trigger a segfault if the size of the pool is 0 or
  if a dimension is negative. This is due to the TensorFlow's implementation of pooling
  operations where the values in the sliding window are not checked to be strictly
  positive. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range.
