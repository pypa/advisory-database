aliases:
- CVE-2021-41204
- GHSA-786j-5qwq-r36x
details: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions
  during TensorFlow's Grappler optimizer phase, constant folding might attempt to
  deep copy a resource tensor. This results in a segfault, as these tensors are supposed
  to not change. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range.
