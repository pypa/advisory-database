id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-41206
details: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions
  several TensorFlow operations are missing validation for the shapes of the tensor
  arguments involved in the call. Depending on the API, this can result in undefined
  behavior and segfault or `CHECK`-fail related crashes but in some scenarios writes
  and reads from heap populated arrays are also possible. We have discovered these
  issues internally via tooling while working on improving/testing GPU op determinism.
  As such, we don't have reproducers and there will be multiple fixes for these issues.
  These fixes will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick these
  commits on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are
  also affected and still in supported range.
