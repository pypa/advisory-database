aliases:
- CVE-2021-41215
- GHSA-x3v8-c8qx-3j3r
details: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions
  the shape inference code for `DeserializeSparse` can trigger a null pointer dereference.
  This is because the shape inference function assumes that the `serialize_sparse`
  tensor is a tensor with positive rank (and having `3` as the last dimension). The
  fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on
  TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range.
