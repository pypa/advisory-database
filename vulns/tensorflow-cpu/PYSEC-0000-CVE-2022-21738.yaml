id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-21738
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation
  of `SparseCountSparseOutput` can be made to crash a TensorFlow process by an integer
  overflow whose result is then used in a memory allocation. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow
  2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
