id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-21740
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation
  of `SparseCountSparseOutput` is vulnerable to a heap overflow. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow
  2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
