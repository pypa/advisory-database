id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-23559
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker can
  craft a TFLite model that would cause an integer overflow in embedding lookup operations.
  Both `embedding_size` and `lookup_size` are products of values provided by the user.
  Hence, a malicious user could trigger overflows in the multiplication. In certain
  scenarios, this can then result in heap OOB read/write. Users are advised to upgrade
  to a patched version.
