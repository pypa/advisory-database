id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-23565
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker can
  trigger denial of service via assertion failure by altering a `SavedModel` on disk
  such that `AttrDef`s of some operation are duplicated. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow
  2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
