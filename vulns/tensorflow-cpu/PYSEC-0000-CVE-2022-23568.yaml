id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-23568
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation
  of `AddManySparseToTensorsMap` is vulnerable to an integer overflow which results
  in a `CHECK`-fail when building new `TensorShape` objects (so, an assert failure
  based denial of service). We are missing some validation on the shapes of the input
  tensors as well as directly constructing a large `TensorShape` with user-provided
  dimensions. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range.
