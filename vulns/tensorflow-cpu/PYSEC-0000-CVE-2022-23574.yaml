id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-23574
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. There is a typo
  in TensorFlow's `SpecializeType` which results in heap OOB read/write. Due to a
  typo, `arg` is initialized to the `i`th mutable argument in a loop where the loop
  index is `j`. Hence it is possible to assign to `arg` from outside the vector of
  arguments. Since this is a mutable proto value, it allows both read and write to
  outside of bounds data. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also
  cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, and TensorFlow 2.6.3, as these are also
  affected and still in supported range.
