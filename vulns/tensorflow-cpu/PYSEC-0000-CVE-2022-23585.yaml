id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-23585
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. When decoding PNG
  images TensorFlow can produce a memory leak if the image is invalid. After calling
  `png::CommonInitDecode(..., &decode)`, the `decode` value contains allocated buffers
  which can only be freed by calling `png::CommonFreeDecode(&decode)`. However, several
  error case in the function implementation invoke the `OP_REQUIRES` macro which immediately
  terminates the execution of the function, without allowing for the memory free to
  occur. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this
  commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are
  also affected and still in supported range.
