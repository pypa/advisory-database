id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-23586
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. A malicious user
  can cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel` such that assertions in
  `function.cc` would be falsified and crash the Python interpreter. The fix will
  be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range.
