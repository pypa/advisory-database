id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-23587
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. Under certain scenarios,
  Grappler component of TensorFlow is vulnerable to an integer overflow during cost
  estimation for crop and resize. Since the cropping parameters are user controlled,
  a malicious person can trigger undefined behavior. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3,
  and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
