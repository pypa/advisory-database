id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-23590
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. A `GraphDef` from
  a TensorFlow `SavedModel` can be maliciously altered to cause a TensorFlow process
  to crash due to encountering a `StatusOr` value that is an error and forcibly extracting
  the value from it. We have patched the issue in multiple GitHub commits and these
  will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0 and TensorFlow 2.7.1, as both are affected.
