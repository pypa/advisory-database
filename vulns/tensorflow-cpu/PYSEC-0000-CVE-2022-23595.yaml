id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-23595
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. When building an
  XLA compilation cache, if default settings are used, TensorFlow triggers a null
  pointer dereference. In the default scenario, all devices are allowed, so `flr->config_proto`
  is `nullptr`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range.
