details: In Tensorflow before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, the
  `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad` implementation has incomplete validation of the shapes
  of its arguments. Although `reverse_index_map_t` and `grad_values_t` are accessed
  in a similar pattern, only `reverse_index_map_t` is validated to be of proper shape.
  Hence, malicious users can pass a bad `grad_values_t` to trigger an assertion failure
  in `vec`, causing denial of service in serving installations. The issue is patched
  in commit 390611e0d45c5793c7066110af37c8514e6a6c54, and is released in TensorFlow
  versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1."
