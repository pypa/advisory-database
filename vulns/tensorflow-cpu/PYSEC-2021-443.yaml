details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The
  implementation of `MatrixDiag*` operations(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/4c4f420e68f1cfaf8f4b6e8e3eb857e9e4c3ff33/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/matrix_diag_op.cc#L195-L197)
  does not validate that the tensor arguments are non-empty. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow
  2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range.
