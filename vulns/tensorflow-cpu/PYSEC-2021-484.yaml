details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An
  attacker can cause a denial of service via a FPE runtime error in `tf.raw_ops.Reverse`.
  This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/36229ea9e9451dac14a8b1f4711c435a1d84a594/tensorflow/core/kernels/reverse_op.cc#L75-L76)
  performs a division based on the first dimension of the tensor argument. The fix
  will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also
  affected and still in supported range.
