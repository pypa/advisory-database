details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The
  implementation of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGradWithArgmax` can cause reads outside of
  bounds of heap allocated data if attacker supplies specially crafted inputs. The
  implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/ac328eaa3870491ababc147822cd04e91a790643/tensorflow/core/kernels/requantization_range_op.cc#L49-L50)
  assumes that the `input_min` and `input_max` tensors have at least one element,
  as it accesses the first element in two arrays. If the tensors are empty, `.flat<T>()`
  is an empty object, backed by an empty array. Hence, accesing even the 0th element
  is a read outside the bounds. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will
  also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3
  and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
