details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The
  implementation of `tf.raw_ops.AvgPool3DGrad` is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow.
  The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/d80ffba9702dc19d1fac74fc4b766b3fa1ee976b/tensorflow/core/kernels/pooling_ops_3d.cc#L376-L450)
  assumes that the `orig_input_shape` and `grad` tensors have similar first and last
  dimensions but does not check that this assumption is validated. The fix will be
  included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also
  affected and still in supported range.
