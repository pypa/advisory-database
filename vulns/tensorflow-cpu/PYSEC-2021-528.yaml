details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The
  implementation of the `OneHot` TFLite operator is vulnerable to a division by zero
  error(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f61c57bd425878be108ec787f4d96390579fb83e/tensorflow/lite/kernels/one_hot.cc#L68-L72).
  An attacker can craft a model such that at least one of the dimensions of `indices`
  would be 0. In turn, the `prefix_dim_size` value would become 0. The fix will be
  included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also
  affected and still in supported range.
