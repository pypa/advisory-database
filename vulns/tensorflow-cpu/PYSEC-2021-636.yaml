details: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions
  the `ImmutableConst` operation in TensorFlow can be tricked into reading arbitrary
  memory contents. This is because the `tstring` TensorFlow string class has a special
  case for memory mapped strings but the operation itself does not offer any support
  for this datatype. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range.
