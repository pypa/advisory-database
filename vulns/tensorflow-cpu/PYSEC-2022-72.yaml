details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. In multiple places,
  TensorFlow uses `tempfile.mktemp` to create temporary files. While this is acceptable
  in testing, in utilities and libraries it is dangerous as a different process can
  create the file between the check for the filename in `mktemp` and the actual creation
  of the file by a subsequent operation (a TOC/TOU type of weakness). In several instances,
  TensorFlow was supposed to actually create a temporary directory instead of a file.
  This logic bug is hidden away by the `mktemp` function usage. We have patched the
  issue in several commits, replacing `mktemp` with the safer `mkstemp`/`mkdtemp`
  functions, according to the usage pattern. Users are advised to upgrade as soon
  as possible.
