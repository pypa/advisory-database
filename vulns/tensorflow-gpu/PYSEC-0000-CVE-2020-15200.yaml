details: In Tensorflow before version 2.3.1, the `RaggedCountSparseOutput` implementation
  does not validate that the input arguments form a valid ragged tensor. In particular,
  there is no validation that the values in the `splits` tensor generate a valid partitioning
  of the `values` tensor. Thus, the code sets up conditions to cause a heap buffer
  overflow. A `BatchedMap` is equivalent to a vector where each element is a hashmap.
  However, if the first element of `splits_values` is not 0, `batch_idx` will never
  be 1, hence there will be no hashmap at index 0 in `per_batch_counts`. Trying to
  access that in the user code results in a segmentation fault. The issue is patched
  in commit 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02 and is released in TensorFlow
  version 2.3.1.
