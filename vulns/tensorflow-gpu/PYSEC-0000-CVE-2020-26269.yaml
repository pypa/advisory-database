- GHSA-9jjw-hf72-3mxw
details: 'In TensorFlow release candidate versions 2.4.0rc*, the general implementation
  for matching filesystem paths to globbing pattern is vulnerable to an access out
  of bounds of the array holding the directories. There are multiple invariants and
  preconditions that are assumed by the parallel implementation of GetMatchingPaths
  but are not verified by the PRs introducing it (#40861 and #44310). Thus, we are
  completely rewriting the implementation to fully specify and validate these. This
  is patched in version 2.4.0. This issue only impacts master branch and the release
  candidates for TF version 2.4. The final release of the 2.4 release will be patched.'
