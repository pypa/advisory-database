details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. If
  the `splits` argument of `RaggedBincount` does not specify a valid `SparseTensor`(https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/sparse/SparseTensor),
  then an attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow. This will cause a read from
  outside the bounds of the `splits` tensor buffer in the implementation of the `RaggedBincount`
  op(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8b677d79167799f71c42fd3fa074476e0295413a/tensorflow/core/kernels/bincount_op.cc#L430-L446).
  Before the `for` loop, `batch_idx` is set to 0. The attacker sets `splits(0)` to
  be 7, hence the `while` loop does not execute and `batch_idx` remains 0. This then
  results in writing to `out(-1, bin)`, which is before the heap allocated buffer
  for the output tensor. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also
  cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2 and TensorFlow 2.3.3, as these are also
  affected.
