details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. Calling
  `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToVariant` with arguments specifying an invalid ragged tensor
  results in a null pointer dereference. The implementation of `RaggedTensorToVariant`
  operations(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/904b3926ed1c6c70380d5313d282d248a776baa1/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_tensor_to_variant_op.cc#L39-L40)
  does not validate that the ragged tensor argument is non-empty. Since `batched_ragged`
  contains no elements, `batched_ragged.splits` is a null vector, thus `batched_ragged.splits(0)`
  will result in dereferencing `nullptr`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
  We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow
  2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
