details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The
  API of `tf.raw_ops.SparseCross` allows combinations which would result in a `CHECK`-failure
  and denial of service. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/3d782b7d47b1bf2ed32bd4a246d6d6cadc4c903d/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_cross_op.cc#L114-L116)
  is tricked to consider a tensor of type `tstring` which in fact contains integral
  elements. Fixing the type confusion by preventing mixing `DT_STRING` and `DT_INT64`
  types solves this issue. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also
  cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and
  TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
