aliases:
- CVE-2021-29563
- GHSA-ph87-fvjr-v33w
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An
  attacker can cause a denial of service by exploiting a `CHECK`-failure coming from
  the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.RFFT`. Eigen code operating on an empty matrix
  can trigger on an assertion and will cause program termination. The fix will be
  included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also
  affected and still in supported range.
