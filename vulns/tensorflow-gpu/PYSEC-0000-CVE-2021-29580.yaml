details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The
  implementation of `tf.raw_ops.FractionalMaxPoolGrad` triggers an undefined behavior
  if one of the input tensors is empty. The code is also vulnerable to a denial of
  service attack as a `CHECK` condition becomes false and aborts the process. The
  implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/169054888d50ce488dfde9ca55d91d6325efbd5b/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_max_pool_op.cc#L215)
  fails to validate that input and output tensors are not empty and are of the same
  rank. Each of these unchecked assumptions is responsible for the above issues. The
  fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on
  TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range.
