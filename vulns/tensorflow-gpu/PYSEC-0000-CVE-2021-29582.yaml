- GHSA-c45w-2wxr-pp53
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. Due
  to lack of validation in `tf.raw_ops.Dequantize`, an attacker can trigger a read
  from outside of bounds of heap allocated data. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/26003593aa94b1742f34dc22ce88a1e17776a67d/tensorflow/core/kernels/dequantize_op.cc#L106-L131)
  accesses the `min_range` and `max_range` tensors in parallel but fails to check
  that they have the same shape. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We
  will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow
  2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
