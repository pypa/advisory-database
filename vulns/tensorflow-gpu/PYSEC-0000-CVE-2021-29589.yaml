details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The
  reference implementation of the `GatherNd` TFLite operator is vulnerable to a division
  by zero error(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0d45ea1ca641b21b73bcf9c00e0179cda284e7e7/tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/reference/reference_ops.h#L966).
  An attacker can craft a model such that `params` input would be an empty tensor.
  In turn, `params_shape.Dims(.)` would be zero, in at least one dimension. The fix
  will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also
  affected and still in supported range.
