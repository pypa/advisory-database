aliases:
- CVE-2021-29595
- GHSA-vf94-36g5-69v8
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The
  implementation of the `DepthToSpace` TFLite operator is vulnerable to a division
  by zero error(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0d45ea1ca641b21b73bcf9c00e0179cda284e7e7/tensorflow/lite/kernels/depth_to_space.cc#L63-L69).
  An attacker can craft a model such that `params->block_size` is 0. The fix will
  be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also
  affected and still in supported range.
