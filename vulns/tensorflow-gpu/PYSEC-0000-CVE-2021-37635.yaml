aliases:

- GHSA-cgfm-62j4-v4rf
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In
  affected versions the implementation of sparse reduction operations in TensorFlow
  can trigger accesses outside of bounds of heap allocated data. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1bc56203f21a5a4995311825ffaba7a670d7747/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_reduce_op.cc#L217-L228)
  fails to validate that each reduction group does not overflow and that each corresponding
  index does not point to outside the bounds of the input tensor. We have patched
  the issue in GitHub commit 87158f43f05f2720a374f3e6d22a7aaa3a33f750. The fix will
  be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range.
