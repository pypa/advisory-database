- GHSA-hp4c-x6r7-6555
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In
  affected versions the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.SparseDenseCwiseDiv` is vulnerable
  to a division by 0 error. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1bc56203f21a5a4995311825ffaba7a670d7747/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_dense_binary_op_shared.cc#L56)
  uses a common class for all binary operations but fails to treat the division by
  0 case separately. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit d9204be9f49520cdaaeb2541d1dc5187b23f31d9.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range.
