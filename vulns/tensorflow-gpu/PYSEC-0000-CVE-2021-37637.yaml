details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It
  is possible to trigger a null pointer dereference in TensorFlow by passing an invalid
  input to `tf.raw_ops.CompressElement`. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/47a06f40411a69c99f381495f490536972152ac0/tensorflow/core/data/compression_utils.cc#L34)
  was accessing the size of a buffer obtained from the return of a separate function
  call before validating that said buffer is valid. We have patched the issue in GitHub
  commit 5dc7f6981fdaf74c8c5be41f393df705841fb7c5. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3,
  and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
