aliases:

- GHSA-v768-w7m9-2vmm
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In
  affected versions an attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference
  to null pointer in `tf.raw_ops.SparseFillEmptyRows`. The shape inference [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/ops/sparse_ops.cc#L608-L634)
  does not validate that the input arguments are not empty tensors. We have patched
  the issue in GitHub commit 578e634b4f1c1c684d4b4294f9e5281b2133b3ed. The fix will
  be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range.
