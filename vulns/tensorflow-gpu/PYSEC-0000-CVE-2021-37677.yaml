- GHSA-qfpc-5pjr-mh26
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In
  affected versions the shape inference code for `tf.raw_ops.Dequantize` has a vulnerability
  that could trigger a denial of service via a segfault if an attacker provides invalid
  arguments. The shape inference [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/ops/array_ops.cc#L2999-L3014)
  uses `axis` to select between two different values for `minmax_rank` which is then
  used to retrieve tensor dimensions. However, code assumes that `axis` can be either
  `-1` or a value greater than `-1`, with no validation for the other values. We have
  patched the issue in GitHub commit da857cfa0fde8f79ad0afdbc94e88b5d4bbec764. The
  fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on
  TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range.
