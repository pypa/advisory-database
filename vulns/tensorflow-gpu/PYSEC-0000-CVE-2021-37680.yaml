id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-37680
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In
  affected versions the implementation of fully connected layers in TFLite is [vulnerable
  to a division by zero error](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/lite/kernels/fully_connected.cc#L226).
  We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 718721986aa137691ee23f03638867151f74935f.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range.
