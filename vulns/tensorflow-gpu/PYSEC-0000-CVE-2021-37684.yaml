aliases:

- GHSA-q7f7-544h-67h9
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In
  affected versions the implementations of pooling in TFLite are vulnerable to division
  by 0 errors as there are no checks for divisors not being 0. We have patched the
  issue in GitHub commit [dfa22b348b70bb89d6d6ec0ff53973bacb4f4695](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/dfa22b348b70bb89d6d6ec0ff53973bacb4f4695).
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range.
