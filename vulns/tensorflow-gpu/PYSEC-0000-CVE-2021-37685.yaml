- GHSA-c545-c4f9-rf6v
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In
  affected versions TFLite's [`expand_dims.cc`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/149562d49faa709ea80df1d99fc41d005b81082a/tensorflow/lite/kernels/expand_dims.cc#L36-L50)
  contains a vulnerability which allows reading one element outside of bounds of heap
  allocated data. If `axis` is a large negative value (e.g., `-100000`), then after
  the first `if` it would still be negative. The check following the `if` statement
  will pass and the `for` loop would read one element before the start of `input_dims.data`
  (when `i = 0`). We have patched the issue in GitHub commit d94ffe08a65400f898241c0374e9edc6fa8ed257.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range.
