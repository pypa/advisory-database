- GHSA-jwf9-w5xm-f437
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In
  affected versions TFLite's [`GatherNd` implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/149562d49faa709ea80df1d99fc41d005b81082a/tensorflow/lite/kernels/gather_nd.cc#L124)
  does not support negative indices but there are no checks for this situation. Hence,
  an attacker can read arbitrary data from the heap by carefully crafting a model
  with negative values in `indices`. Similar issue exists in [`Gather` implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/149562d49faa709ea80df1d99fc41d005b81082a/tensorflow/lite/kernels/gather.cc).
  We have patched the issue in GitHub commits bb6a0383ed553c286f87ca88c207f6774d5c4a8f
  and eb921122119a6b6e470ee98b89e65d721663179d. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3,
  and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
