aliases:
- CVE-2021-41200
- GHSA-gh8h-7j2j-qv4f
details: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions
  if `tf.summary.create_file_writer` is called with non-scalar arguments code crashes
  due to a `CHECK`-fail. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also
  cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range.
