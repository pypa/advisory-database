details: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affeced versions
  during execution, `EinsumHelper::ParseEquation()` is supposed to set the flags in
  `input_has_ellipsis` vector and `*output_has_ellipsis` boolean to indicate whether
  there is ellipsis in the corresponding inputs and output. However, the code only
  changes these flags to `true` and never assigns `false`. This results in unitialized
  variable access if callers assume that `EinsumHelper::ParseEquation()` always sets
  these flags. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range.
