- GHSA-xrqm-fpgr-6hhx
details: 'TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions while calculating the size of the output within the `tf.range` kernel,
  there is a conditional statement of type `int64 = condition ? int64 : double`. Due
  to C++ implicit conversion rules, both branches of the condition will be cast to
  `double` and the result would be truncated before the assignment. This result in
  overflows. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range.'
