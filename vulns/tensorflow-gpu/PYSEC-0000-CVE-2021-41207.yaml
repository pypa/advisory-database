aliases:
- CVE-2021-41207
- GHSA-7v94-64hj-m82h
details: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions
  the implementation of `ParallelConcat` misses some input validation and can produce
  a division by 0. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range.
