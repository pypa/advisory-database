aliases:

- GHSA-5crj-c72x-m7gq
details: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions
  the process of building the control flow graph for a TensorFlow model is vulnerable
  to a null pointer exception when nodes that should be paired are not. This occurs
  because the code assumes that the first node in the pairing (e.g., an `Enter` node)
  always exists when encountering the second node (e.g., an `Exit` node). When this
  is not the case, `parent` is `nullptr` so dereferencing it causes a crash. The fix
  will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range.
