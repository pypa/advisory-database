aliases:
- CVE-2021-41218
- GHSA-9crf-c6qr-r273
details: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions
  the shape inference code for `AllToAll` can be made to execute a division by 0.
  This occurs whenever the `split_count` argument is 0. The fix will be included in
  TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow
  2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
