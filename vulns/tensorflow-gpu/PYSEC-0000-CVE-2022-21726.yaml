id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-21726
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation
  of `Dequantize` does not fully validate the value of `axis` and can result in heap
  OOB accesses. The `axis` argument can be `-1` (the default value for the optional
  argument) or any other positive value at most the number of dimensions of the input.
  Unfortunately, the upper bound is not checked and this results in reading past the
  end of the array containing the dimensions of the input tensor. The fix will be
  included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range.
