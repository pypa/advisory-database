id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-21729
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation
  of `UnravelIndex` is vulnerable to a division by zero caused by an integer overflow
  bug. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this
  commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are
  also affected and still in supported range.
