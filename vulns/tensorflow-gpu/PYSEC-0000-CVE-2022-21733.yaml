id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-21733
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation
  of `StringNGrams` can be used to trigger a denial of service attack by causing an
  out of memory condition after an integer overflow. We are missing a validation on
  `pad_witdh` and that result in computing a negative value for `ngram_width` which
  is later used to allocate parts of the output. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3,
  and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
