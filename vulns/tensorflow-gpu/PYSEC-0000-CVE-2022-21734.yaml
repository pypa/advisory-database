id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-21734
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation
  of `MapStage` is vulnerable a `CHECK`-fail if the key tensor is not a scalar. The
  fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on
  TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range.
