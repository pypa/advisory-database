id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-23560
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker can
  craft a TFLite model that would allow limited reads and writes outside of arrays
  in TFLite. This exploits missing validation in the conversion from sparse tensors
  to dense tensors. The fix is included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range. Users are advised to upgrade as
  soon as possible.
