id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-23566
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. TensorFlow is vulnerable
  to a heap OOB write in `Grappler`. The `set_output` function writes to an array
  at the specified index. Hence, this gives a malicious user a write primitive. The
  fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on
  TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range.
