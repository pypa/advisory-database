id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-23567
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementations
  of `Sparse*Cwise*` ops are vulnerable to integer overflows. These can be used to
  trigger large allocations (so, OOM based denial of service) or `CHECK`-fails when
  building new `TensorShape` objects (so, assert failures based denial of service).
  We are missing some validation on the shapes of the input tensors as well as directly
  constructing a large `TensorShape` with user-provided dimensions. The fix will be
  included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range.
