id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-23572
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. Under certain scenarios,
  TensorFlow can fail to specialize a type during shape inference. This case is covered
  by the `DCHECK` function however, `DCHECK` is a no-op in production builds and an
  assertion failure in debug builds. In the first case execution proceeds to the `ValueOrDie`
  line. This results in an assertion failure as `ret` contains an error `Status`,
  not a value. In the second case we also get a crash due to the assertion failure.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.7.1, and TensorFlow 2.6.3, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range.
