id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-23576
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation
  of `OpLevelCostEstimator::CalculateOutputSize` is vulnerable to an integer overflow
  if an attacker can create an operation which would involve tensors with large enough
  number of elements. We can have a large enough number of dimensions in `output_shape.dim()`
  or just a small number of dimensions being large enough to cause an overflow in
  the multiplication. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range.
