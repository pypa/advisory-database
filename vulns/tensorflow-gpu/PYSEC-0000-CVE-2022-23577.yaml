id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-23577
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation
  of `GetInitOp` is vulnerable to a crash caused by dereferencing a null pointer.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range.
