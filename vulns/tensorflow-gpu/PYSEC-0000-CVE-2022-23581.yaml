id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-23581
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The Grappler optimizer
  in TensorFlow can be used to cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel`
  such that `IsSimplifiableReshape` would trigger `CHECK` failures. The fix will be
  included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range.
