id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-23588
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. A malicious user
  can cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel` such that Grappler optimizer
  would attempt to build a tensor using a reference `dtype`. This would result in
  a crash due to a `CHECK`-fail in the `Tensor` constructor as reference types are
  not allowed. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range.
