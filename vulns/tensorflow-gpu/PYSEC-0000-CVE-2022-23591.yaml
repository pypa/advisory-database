id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-23591
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `GraphDef` format
  in TensorFlow does not allow self recursive functions. The runtime assumes that
  this invariant is satisfied. However, a `GraphDef` containing a fragment such as
  the following can be consumed when loading a `SavedModel`. This would result in
  a stack overflow during execution as resolving each `NodeDef` means resolving the
  function itself and its nodes. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We
  will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow
  2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
