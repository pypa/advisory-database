id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-23593
details: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `simplifyBroadcast`
  function in the MLIR-TFRT infrastructure in TensorFlow is vulnerable to a segfault
  (hence, denial of service), if called with scalar shapes. If all shapes are scalar,
  then `maxRank` is 0, so we build an empty `SmallVector`. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.8.0. This is the only affected version.
