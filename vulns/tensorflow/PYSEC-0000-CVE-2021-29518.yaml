id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-29518
package:
  name: tensorflow
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In
  eager mode (default in TF 2.0 and later), session operations are invalid. However,
  users could still call the raw ops associated with them and trigger a null pointer
  dereference. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/eebb96c2830d48597d055d247c0e9aebaea94cd5/tensorflow/core/kernels/session_ops.cc#L104)
  dereferences the session state pointer without checking if it is valid. Thus, in
  eager mode, `ctx->session_state()` is nullptr and the call of the member function
  is undefined behavior. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also
  cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and
  TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
