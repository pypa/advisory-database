id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-29520
package:
  name: tensorflow
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. Missing
  validation between arguments to `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackprop*` operations can result
  in heap buffer overflows. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/4814fafb0ca6b5ab58a09411523b2193fed23fed/tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_grad_shape_utils.cc#L94-L153)
  assumes that the `input`, `filter_sizes` and `out_backprop` tensors have the same
  shape, as they are accessed in parallel. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3,
  TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range.
