id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-29521
package:
  name: tensorflow
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. Specifying
  a negative dense shape in `tf.raw_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput` results in a segmentation
  fault being thrown out from the standard library as `std::vector` invariants are
  broken. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8f7b60ee8c0206a2c99802e3a4d1bb55d2bc0624/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L199-L213)
  assumes the first element of the dense shape is always positive and uses it to initialize
  a `BatchedMap<T>` (i.e., `std::vector<absl::flat_hash_map<int64,T>>`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8f7b60ee8c0206a2c99802e3a4d1bb55d2bc0624/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L27))
  data structure. If the `shape` tensor has more than one element, `num_batches` is
  the first value in `shape`. Ensuring that the `dense_shape` argument is a valid
  tensor shape (that is, all elements are non-negative) solves this issue. The fix
  will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.4.2 and TensorFlow 2.3.3.
