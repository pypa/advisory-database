id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-29530
package:
  name: tensorflow
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An
  attacker can trigger a null pointer dereference by providing an invalid `permutation`
  to `tf.raw_ops.SparseMatrixSparseCholesky`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/080f1d9e257589f78b3ffb75debf584168aa6062/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse/sparse_cholesky_op.cc#L85-L86)
  fails to properly validate the input arguments. Although `ValidateInputs` is called
  and there are checks in the body of this function, the code proceeds to the next
  line in `ValidateInputs` since `OP_REQUIRES`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/080f1d9e257589f78b3ffb75debf584168aa6062/tensorflow/core/framework/op_requires.h#L41-L48)
  is a macro that only exits the current function. Thus, the first validation condition
  that fails in `ValidateInputs` will cause an early return from that function. However,
  the caller will continue execution from the next line. The fix is to either explicitly
  check `context->status()` or to convert `ValidateInputs` to return a `Status`. The
  fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on
  TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range.
