id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-29533
package:
  name: tensorflow
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An
  attacker can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK` failure by passing an empty
  image to `tf.raw_ops.DrawBoundingBoxes`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/ea34a18dc3f5c8d80a40ccca1404f343b5d55f91/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/draw_bounding_box_op.cc#L148-L165)
  uses `CHECK_*` assertions instead of `OP_REQUIRES` to validate user controlled inputs.
  Whereas `OP_REQUIRES` allows returning an error condition back to the user, the
  `CHECK_*` macros result in a crash if the condition is false, similar to `assert`.
  In this case, `height` is 0 from the `images` input. This results in `max_box_row_clamp`
  being negative and the assertion being falsified, followed by aborting program execution.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as
  these are also affected and still in supported range.
