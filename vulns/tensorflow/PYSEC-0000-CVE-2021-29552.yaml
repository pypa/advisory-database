id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-29552
package:
  name: tensorflow
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An
  attacker can cause a denial of service by controlling the values of `num_segments`
  tensor argument for `UnsortedSegmentJoin`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a2a607db15c7cd01d754d37e5448d72a13491bdb/tensorflow/core/kernels/unsorted_segment_join_op.cc#L92-L93)
  assumes that the `num_segments` tensor is a valid scalar. Since the tensor is empty
  the `CHECK` involved in `.scalar<T>()()` that checks that the number of elements
  is exactly 1 will be invalidated and this would result in process termination. The
  fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on
  TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range.
