id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-29572
package:
  name: tensorflow
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The
  implementation of `tf.raw_ops.SdcaOptimizer` triggers undefined behavior due to
  dereferencing a null pointer. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/60a45c8b6192a4699f2e2709a2645a751d435cc3/tensorflow/core/kernels/sdca_internal.cc)
  does not validate that the user supplied arguments satisfy all constraints expected
  by the op(https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/raw_ops/SdcaOptimizer).
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as
  these are also affected and still in supported range.
