id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-29575
package:
  name: tensorflow
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The
  implementation of `tf.raw_ops.ReverseSequence` allows for stack overflow and/or
  `CHECK`-fail based denial of service. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5b3b071975e01f0d250c928b2a8f901cd53b90a7/tensorflow/core/kernels/reverse_sequence_op.cc#L114-L118)
  fails to validate that `seq_dim` and `batch_dim` arguments are valid. Negative values
  for `seq_dim` can result in stack overflow or `CHECK`-failure, depending on the
  version of Eigen code used to implement the operation. Similar behavior can be exhibited
  by invalid values of `batch_dim`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
  We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow
  2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
