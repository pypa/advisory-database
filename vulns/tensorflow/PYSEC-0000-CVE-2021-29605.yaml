id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-29605
package:
  name: tensorflow
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The
  TFLite code for allocating `TFLiteIntArray`s is vulnerable to an integer overflow
  issue(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/4ceffae632721e52bf3501b736e4fe9d1221cdfa/tensorflow/lite/c/common.c#L24-L27).
  An attacker can craft a model such that the `size` multiplier is so large that the
  return value overflows the `int` datatype and becomes negative. In turn, this results
  in invalid value being given to `malloc`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/4ceffae632721e52bf3501b736e4fe9d1221cdfa/tensorflow/lite/c/common.c#L47-L52).
  In this case, `ret->size` would dereference an invalid pointer. The fix will be
  included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also
  affected and still in supported range.
