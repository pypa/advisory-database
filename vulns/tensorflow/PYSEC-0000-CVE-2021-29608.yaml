id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-29608
package:
  name: tensorflow
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. Due
  to lack of validation in `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToTensor`, an attacker can exploit
  an undefined behavior if input arguments are empty. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/656e7673b14acd7835dc778867f84916c6d1cac2/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_tensor_to_tensor_op.cc#L356-L360)
  only checks that one of the tensors is not empty, but does not check for the other
  ones. There are multiple `DCHECK` validations to prevent heap OOB, but these are
  no-op in release builds, hence they don't prevent anything. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick these commits on TensorFlow 2.4.2,
  TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range.
