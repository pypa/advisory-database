id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-29610
package:
  name: tensorflow
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The
  validation in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV2` allows invalid values for `axis`
  argument:. The validation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.cc#L74-L77)
  uses `||` to mix two different conditions. If `axis_ < -1` the condition in `OP_REQUIRES`
  will still be true, but this value of `axis_` results in heap underflow. This allows
  attackers to read/write to other data on the heap. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3,
  TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range.
