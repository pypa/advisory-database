id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-37650
package:
  name: tensorflow
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In
  affected versions the implementation for `tf.raw_ops.ExperimentalDatasetToTFRecord`
  and `tf.raw_ops.DatasetToTFRecord` can trigger heap buffer overflow and segmentation
  fault. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/data/experimental/to_tf_record_op.cc#L93-L102)
  assumes that all records in the dataset are of string type. However, there is no
  check for that, and the example given above uses numeric types. We have patched
  the issue in GitHub commit e0b6e58c328059829c3eb968136f17aa72b6c876. The fix will
  be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range.
