id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-37673
package:
  name: tensorflow
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In
  affected versions an attacker can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK`-fail
  in `tf.raw_ops.MapStage`. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/map_stage_op.cc#L513)
  does not check that the `key` input is a valid non-empty tensor. We have patched
  the issue in GitHub commit d7de67733925de196ec8863a33445b73f9562d1d. The fix will
  be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range.
