id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-41197
details: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions
  TensorFlow allows tensor to have a large number of dimensions and each dimension
  can be as large as desired. However, the total number of elements in a tensor must
  fit within an `int64_t`. If an overflow occurs, `MultiplyWithoutOverflow` would
  return a negative result. In the majority of TensorFlow codebase this then results
  in a `CHECK`-failure. Newer constructs exist which return a `Status` instead of
  crashing the binary. This is similar to CVE-2021-29584. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow
  2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
