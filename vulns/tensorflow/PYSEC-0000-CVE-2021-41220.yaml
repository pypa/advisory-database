id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-41220
details: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions
  the async implementation of `CollectiveReduceV2` suffers from a memory leak and
  a use after free. This occurs due to the asynchronous computation and the fact that
  objects that have been `std::move()`d from are still accessed. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, as
  this version is the only one that is also affected.
