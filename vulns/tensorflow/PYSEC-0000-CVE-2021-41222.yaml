id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-41222
details: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions
  the implementation of `SplitV` can trigger a segfault is an attacker supplies negative
  arguments. This occurs whenever `size_splits` contains more than one value and at
  least one value is negative. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will
  also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow
  2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
