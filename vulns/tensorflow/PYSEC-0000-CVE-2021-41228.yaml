id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-41228
details: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions
  TensorFlow's `saved_model_cli` tool is vulnerable to a code injection as it calls
  `eval` on user supplied strings. This can be used by attackers to run arbitrary
  code on the plaform where the CLI tool runs. However, given that the tool is always
  run manually, the impact of this is not severe. We have patched this by adding a
  `safe` flag which defaults to `True` and an explicit warning for users. The fix
  will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range.
