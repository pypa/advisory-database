details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In
  affected versions if the arguments to `tf.raw_ops.RaggedGather` don't determine
  a valid ragged tensor code can trigger a read from outside of bounds of heap allocated
  buffers. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_gather_op.cc#L70)
  directly reads the first dimension of a tensor shape before checking that said tensor
  has rank of at least 1 (i.e., it is not a scalar). Furthermore, the implementation
  does not check that the list given by `params_nested_splits` is not an empty list
  of tensors. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit a2b743f6017d7b97af1fe49087ae15f0ac634373.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range.
