details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In
  affected versions the implementation of division in TFLite is [vulnerable to a division
  by 0 error](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/lite/kernels/div.cc).
  There is no check that the divisor tensor does not contain zero elements. We have
  patched the issue in GitHub commit 1e206baedf8bef0334cca3eb92bab134ef525a28. The
  fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on
  TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range.
