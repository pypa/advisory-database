id: PYSEC-2020-142
details: A mis-handling of invalid unicode characters in the Java implementation of
  Tink versions prior to 1.5 allows an attacker to change the ID part of a ciphertext,
  which result in the creation of a second ciphertext that can decrypt to the same
  plaintext. This can be a problem with encrypting deterministic AEAD with a single
  key, and rely on a unique ciphertext-per-plaintext.
