package:
  name: tlslite-ng
  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: Vulnerability in tlslite-ng
details: 'tlslite-ng is an open source python library that implements SSL and TLS
  cryptographic protocols. In tlslite-ng before versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39,
  the code that performs decryption and padding check in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption
  is data dependant. In particular, the code has multiple ways in which it leaks information
  about the decrypted ciphertext. It aborts as soon as the plaintext doesn''t start
  with 0x00, 0x02. All TLS servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications
  that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable. This is patched in versions
  0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches depend on Python processing the individual
  bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case (see reference).
  As such, users that require side-channel resistance are recommended to use different
  TLS implementations, as stated in the security policy of tlslite-ng.'
