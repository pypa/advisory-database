id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-23607
details: treq is an HTTP library inspired by requests but written on top of Twisted's
  Agents. Treq's request methods (`treq.get`, `treq.post`, etc.) and `treq.client.HTTPClient`
  constructor accept cookies as a dictionary. Such cookies are not bound to a single
  domain, and are therefore sent to *every* domain ("supercookies"). This can potentially
  cause sensitive information to leak upon an HTTP redirect to a different domain.,
  e.g. should `https://example.com` redirect to `http://cloudstorageprovider.com`
  the latter will receive the cookie `session`. Treq 2021.1.0 and later bind cookies
  given to request methods (`treq.request`, `treq.get`, `HTTPClient.request`, `HTTPClient.get`,
  etc.) to the origin of the *url* parameter. Users are advised to upgrade. For users
  unable to upgrade Instead of passing a dictionary as the *cookies* argument, pass
  a `http.cookiejar.CookieJar` instance with properly domain- and scheme-scoped cookies
  in it.
