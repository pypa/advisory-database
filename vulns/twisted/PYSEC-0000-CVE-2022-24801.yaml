id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-24801
details: 'Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications, supporting
  Python 3.6+. Prior to version 22.4.0rc1, the Twisted Web HTTP 1.1 server, located
  in the `twisted.web.http` module, parsed several HTTP request constructs more leniently
  than permitted by RFC 7230. This non-conformant parsing can lead to desync if requests
  pass through multiple HTTP parsers, potentially resulting in HTTP request smuggling.
  Users who may be affected use Twisted Web''s HTTP 1.1 server and/or proxy and also
  pass requests through a different HTTP server and/or proxy. The Twisted Web client
  is not affected. The HTTP 2.0 server uses a different parser, so it is not affected.
  The issue has been addressed in Twisted 22.4.0rc1. Two workarounds are available:
  Ensure any vulnerabilities in upstream proxies have been addressed, such as by upgrading
  them; or filter malformed requests by other means, such as configuration of an upstream
  proxy.'
