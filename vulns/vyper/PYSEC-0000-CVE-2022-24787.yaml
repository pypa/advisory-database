id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-24787
details: Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
  In version 0.3.1 and prior, bytestrings can have dirty bytes in them, resulting
  in the word-for-word comparisons giving incorrect results. Even without dirty nonzero
  bytes, two bytestrings can compare to equal if one ends with `"\x00"` because there
  is no comparison of the length. A patch is available and expected to be part of
  the 0.3.2 release. There are currently no known workarounds.
