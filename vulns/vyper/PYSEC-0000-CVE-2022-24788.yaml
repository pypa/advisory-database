id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-24788
details: Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine.
  Versions of vyper prior to 0.3.2 suffer from a potential buffer overrun. Importing
  a function from a JSON interface which returns `bytes` generates bytecode which
  does not clamp bytes length, potentially resulting in a buffer overrun. Users are
  advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
