id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-21683
details: Wagtail is a Django based content management system focused on flexibility
  and user experience. When notifications for new replies in comment threads are sent,
  they are sent to all users who have replied or commented anywhere on the site, rather
  than only in the relevant threads. This means that a user could listen in to new
  comment replies on pages they have not have editing access to, as long as they have
  left a comment or reply somewhere on the site. A patched version has been released
  as Wagtail 2.15.2, which restores the intended behaviour - to send notifications
  for new replies to the participants in the active thread only (editing permissions
  are not considered). New comments can be disabled by setting `WAGTAILADMIN_COMMENTS_ENABLED
  = False` in the Django settings file.
