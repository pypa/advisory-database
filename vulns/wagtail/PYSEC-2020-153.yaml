  name: wagtail
  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: Vulnerability in wagtail
details: In Wagtail before versions 2.7.2 and 2.8.2, a potential timing attack exists
  on pages or documents that have been protected with a shared password through Wagtail's
  "Privacy" controls. This password check is performed through a character-by-character
  string comparison, and so an attacker who is able to measure the time taken by this
  check to a high degree of accuracy could potentially use timing differences to gain
  knowledge of the password. This is understood to be feasible on a local network,
  but not on the public internet. Privacy settings that restrict access to pages/documents
  on a per-user or per-group basis (as opposed to a shared password) are unaffected
  by this vulnerability. This has been patched in 2.7.3, 2.8.2, 2.9.
