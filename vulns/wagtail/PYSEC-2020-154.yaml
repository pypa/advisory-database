  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: Vulnerability in wagtail
details: In Wagtail before versions 2.7.4 and 2.9.3, when a form page type is made
  available to Wagtail editors through the `wagtail.contrib.forms` app, and the page
  template is built using Django's standard form rendering helpers such as form.as_p,
  any HTML tags used within a form field's help text will be rendered unescaped in
  the page. Allowing HTML within help text is an intentional design decision by Django;
  however, as a matter of policy Wagtail does not allow editors to insert arbitrary
  HTML by default, as this could potentially be used to carry out cross-site scripting
  attacks, including privilege escalation. This functionality should therefore not
  have been made available to editor-level users. The vulnerability is not exploitable
  by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. Patched versions
  have been released as Wagtail 2.7.4 (for the LTS 2.7 branch) and Wagtail 2.9.3 (for
  the current 2.9 branch). In these versions, help text will be escaped to prevent
  the inclusion of HTML tags. Site owners who wish to re-enable the use of HTML within
  help text (and are willing to accept the risk of this being exploited by editors)
  may set WAGTAILFORMS_HELP_TEXT_ALLOW_HTML = True in their configuration settings.
  Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions can secure their form
  page templates by rendering forms field-by-field as per Django's documentation,
  but omitting the |safe filter when outputting the help text.
