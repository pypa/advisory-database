id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-24761
details: 'Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. When
  using Waitress versions 2.1.0 and prior behind a proxy that does not properly validate
  the incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230 standard, Waitress and the frontend
  proxy may disagree on where one request starts and where it ends. This would allow
  requests to be smuggled via the front-end proxy to waitress and later behavior.
  There are two classes of vulnerability that may lead to request smuggling that are
  addressed by this advisory: The use of Python''s `int()` to parse strings into integers,
  leading to `+10` to be parsed as `10`, or `0x01` to be parsed as `1`, where as the
  standard specifies that the string should contain only digits or hex digits; and
  Waitress does not support chunk extensions, however it was discarding them without
  validating that they did not contain illegal characters. This vulnerability has
  been patched in Waitress 2.1.1. A workaround is available. When deploying a proxy
  in front of waitress, turning on any and all functionality to make sure that the
  request matches the RFC7230 standard. Certain proxy servers may not have this functionality
  though and users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of waitress instead.'
