id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-39216
details: Wasmtime is an open source runtime for WebAssembly & WASI. In Wasmtime from
  version 0.19.0 and before version 0.30.0 there was a use-after-free bug when passing
  `externref`s from the host to guest Wasm content. To trigger the bug, you have to
  explicitly pass multiple `externref`s from the host to a Wasm instance at the same
  time, either by passing multiple `externref`s as arguments from host code to a Wasm
  function, or returning multiple `externref`s to Wasm from a multi-value return function
  defined in the host. If you do not have host code that matches one of these shapes,
  then you are not impacted. If Wasmtime's `VMExternRefActivationsTable` became filled
  to capacity after passing the first `externref` in, then passing in the second `externref`
  could trigger a garbage collection. However the first `externref` is not rooted
  until we pass control to Wasm, and therefore could be reclaimed by the collector
  if nothing else was holding a reference to it or otherwise keeping it alive. Then,
  when control was passed to Wasm after the garbage collection, Wasm could use the
  first `externref`, which at this point has already been freed. We have reason to
  believe that the effective impact of this bug is relatively small because usage
  of `externref` is currently quite rare. The bug has been fixed, and users should
  upgrade to Wasmtime 0.30.0. If you cannot upgrade Wasmtime yet, you can avoid the
  bug by disabling reference types support in Wasmtime by passing `false` to `wasmtime::Config::wasm_reference_types`.
