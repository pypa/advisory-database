id: PYSEC-2021-88
package:
  name: zope
  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: ""
details: Zope is an open-source web application server. In Zope versions prior to
  4.6 and 5.2, users can access untrusted modules indirectly through Python modules
  that are available for direct use. By default, only users with the Manager role
  can add or edit Zope Page Templates through the web, but sites that allow untrusted
  users to add/edit Zope Page Templates through the web are at risk from this vulnerability.
  The problem has been fixed in Zope 5.2 and 4.6. As a workaround, a site administrator
  can restrict adding/editing Zope Page Templates through the web using the standard
  Zope user/role permission mechanisms. Untrusted users should not be assigned the
  Zope Manager role and adding/editing Zope Page Templates through the web should
  be restricted to trusted users only.
